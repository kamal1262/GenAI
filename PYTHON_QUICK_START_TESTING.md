# Python Quick Start: Testing Cline Rules

This guide will walk you through testing the agentic coding rules with Python step-by-step.

## üöÄ Ready to Test - Python Edition

I've set up a complete Python test environment for you:

```
‚úÖ Python test project created: python-cline-test/
‚úÖ Rules copied: .clinerules/ directory populated
‚úÖ Python project structure: src/, tests/, docs/
‚úÖ pyproject.toml configured with modern Python tooling
‚úÖ Sample Python code with type hints, error handling, logging
‚úÖ Comprehensive test suite with pytest
‚úÖ Development tools: black, flake8, mypy, pytest-cov
```

## üß™ Let's Run the Python Tests

### Test 1: Memory Check (Immediate Test)
**Right now, ask me:**
```
WE CAN DO IT
```

**Expected Response**: I should respond with "WE CAN DO IT" - this confirms the agent-rules.xml is loaded.

### Test 2: Python Code Quality Standards
**Ask me:**
```
Add a new function to calculate the average of a list of numbers with proper error handling and tests
```

**What to look for:**
- Type hints for all parameters and return values
- Comprehensive input validation
- Proper error handling with specific exceptions
- Detailed docstring following Python conventions
- Logging where appropriate
- Corresponding unit tests with edge cases
- Clean, PEP 8 compliant code

### Test 3: Confidence Assessment for Python
**Ask me:**
```
I want to add a user authentication system with JWT tokens to this Python project. What's your confidence level for implementing this?
```

**What to look for:**
- Should reference 0-10 confidence scale
- Ask about Python-specific considerations:
  - Which framework (FastAPI, Django, Flask)?
  - Database requirements
  - Security libraries (PyJWT, passlib, etc.)
  - Testing strategy for auth flows
- Should not proceed until confidence is 8+ or gaps addressed

### Test 4: Python Testing Standards
**Ask me:**
```
Write comprehensive unit tests for the get_user_info function, including edge cases and error scenarios
```

**What to look for:**
- Organized test classes
- Descriptive test method names
- Tests for happy path, edge cases, and error conditions
- Proper use of pytest fixtures if needed
- Mocking external dependencies
- Assertion messages where helpful
- Test isolation (each test independent)

### Test 5: Repository Analysis (Python-focused)
**Ask me:**
```
Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the python-cline-test project using the repository analysis framework
```

**What to look for:**
- Creates `.cline_docs/repository-analysis.md`
- Python-specific analysis:
  - Package structure and imports
  - Dependencies in pyproject.toml
  - Testing framework and coverage
  - Code quality tools configuration
- Confidence assessments for each component
- Mermaid diagrams showing Python project structure
- Offers to create memory bank

### Test 6: Python Development Workflow
**Ask me:**
```
Set up a complete development workflow for this Python project including linting, formatting, type checking, and testing
```

**What to look for:**
- Configuration for black, flake8, mypy
- pytest configuration with coverage
- Pre-commit hooks or similar
- Virtual environment setup
- Development dependencies properly configured
- CI/CD considerations

## üêç Python-Specific Validation

### Code Quality Checks
- [ ] Type hints used consistently
- [ ] Docstrings follow Python conventions (Google/NumPy style)
- [ ] Error handling uses appropriate exception types
- [ ] Logging configured properly (not using print statements)
- [ ] PEP 8 compliance
- [ ] No code duplication

### Testing Standards
- [ ] Tests organized in classes by functionality
- [ ] Test names are descriptive and follow naming conventions
- [ ] Edge cases and error conditions tested
- [ ] Mocking used appropriately for external dependencies
- [ ] Test coverage is comprehensive
- [ ] Tests are independent and can run in any order

### Project Structure
- [ ] Proper package structure with `__init__.py` files
- [ ] Clear separation of source code and tests
- [ ] Modern Python project configuration (pyproject.toml)
- [ ] Development dependencies properly specified
- [ ] Documentation is clear and comprehensive

## üîß Testing the Python Environment

### Run the Actual Tests
```bash
cd python-cline-test

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run tests
pytest -v

# Check code quality
black --check src/ tests/
flake8 src/ tests/
mypy src/
```

### Expected Results
- All tests should pass
- Code should be properly formatted
- No linting errors
- Type checking should pass
- Coverage should be high (>90%)

## üéØ Python-Specific Success Criteria

### Code Generation Quality
- **Type Safety**: All functions have proper type hints
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive input validation and exception handling
- **Documentation**: Clear docstrings with Args, Returns, Raises sections
- **Logging**: Appropriate use of logging instead of print statements
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage with edge cases

### Python Best Practices
- **PEP 8 Compliance**: Code follows Python style guidelines
- **Modern Python**: Uses current Python features and idioms
- **Package Structure**: Proper module organization
- **Dependency Management**: Clean dependency specification
- **Development Tools**: Proper integration of linting, formatting, type checking

## üöÄ Next Steps for Python Projects

### If Tests Pass ‚úÖ
1. **Copy rules to your Python projects**:
   ```bash
   cp -r python-cline-test/.clinerules /path/to/your/python/project/
   ```

2. **Adapt for your Python stack**:
   - Add Django-specific rules for Django projects
   - Add FastAPI-specific rules for API projects
   - Add data science rules for ML/AI projects

3. **Team adoption**:
   - Share Python development standards
   - Include rules in project templates
   - Train team on expected Cline behaviors

### Framework-Specific Extensions

Create additional rules for your Python frameworks:

```bash
# For Django projects
cp cline/.clinerules/frameworks/django.xml .clinerules/  # (if available)

# For FastAPI projects
cp cline/.clinerules/frameworks/fastapi.xml .clinerules/  # (if available)
```

## üí° Python Pro Tips

1. **Virtual Environments**: Always test in isolated environments
2. **Type Checking**: Use mypy for static type analysis
3. **Code Formatting**: Use black for consistent formatting
4. **Testing**: Aim for high test coverage with meaningful tests
5. **Documentation**: Keep docstrings up to date
6. **Dependencies**: Pin versions for reproducible builds

## üêõ Python-Specific Troubleshooting

### Import Issues
- Check `__init__.py` files are present
- Verify PYTHONPATH includes src directory
- Use relative imports correctly

### Testing Issues
- Ensure pytest can discover tests
- Check test file naming conventions
- Verify test dependencies are installed

### Type Checking Issues
- Install type stubs for third-party libraries
- Configure mypy properly in pyproject.toml
- Use `# type: ignore` sparingly and with comments
