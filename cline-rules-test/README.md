# Cline Rules Test Project

This is a test project to validate the agentic coding rules and templates functionality with Cline.

## Purpose

This project serves as a testing ground to ensure that:
- Cline rules are properly loaded and applied
- Confidence assessment framework works correctly
- Development standards are followed
- Memory bank functionality operates as expected
- Repository analysis generates comprehensive documentation
